<h1>My Dearest Sanusha,</h1>

<p>
I don't know if words are enough to explain how much you mean to me, but I still want to try—because you deserve to know.
</p>
<p>
From the moment you came into my life, everything started to feel a little brighter, a little calmer, and a lot more meaningful. The way you smile, the way you talk, the way you're simply you — all of it stays with me, even when we're apart.
</p>
<p>
You make ordinary moments feel special, and difficult days feel lighter just by being there. Being with you has taught me what it truly means to care for someone deeply, without hesitation. I admire your heart, your strength, and the kindness you show so naturally.
</p>
<p>
Sanusha, I like you more than I can ever properly explain. I think of you more than you probably realize, and I feel grateful every single day that I get to call you mine. No matter what comes our way, I want you to know that you are cherished, appreciated, and deeply loved.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for being you — and for letting me be close to your heart.
</p>
<p class="signature">
Always yours,<br>Navaneeth
